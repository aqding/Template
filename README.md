# Template

This repository is a template for building MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) stack applications.
It provides a functioning application that has a React + Typescript frontend and a Typescript backend, as well as
an Express application and MongoDB database connection and sessions.

## How to use this template

You can use this template by downloading it from GitHub. You will need to add a .env file containing
PORT, MONGO_SRV, and SECRET for the server port, MongoDB SRV, and session secret, respectively, for the server
to run properly.

Once set up, you can run **npm run dev** to start the server on the specified port, and **npm run hotloader** to
start the hotloader on port 8000.

## Enjoy :)
